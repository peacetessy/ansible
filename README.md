# Ansible-Based Cisco Switch Configuration Tool

This project automates the configuration of Cisco switches for ISE (Identity Services Engine) deployments using Ansible. It provides a guided CLI for generating configuration files, validating them, testing connectivity, applying configurations, and generating PDF reports of the results.


## Functionalities

- Automated generation of configuration and secrets files for Cisco switches and servers.
- Validation of configuration files to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Connectivity testing to network devices using SSH or TACACS+ protocols.
- Deployment of configurations to Cisco switches via Ansible playbooks.
- Generation of comprehensive PDF reports detailing configuration outcomes.

## Workflow

1. **Generate Configuration Files**  
   Use the menu to generate YAML configuration and secrets files for switches and servers.

2. **Edit the Files**  
   Fill in the generated files with your network and authentication details.

3. **Apply Configurations**  
   Use the menu to validate files, test connectivity, and apply configurations to your switches.

4. **Review Reports**  
   After execution, a PDF report will be generated summarizing the results.
